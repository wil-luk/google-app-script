New approach
1. convert tutor and student timeslots to numbers
   (e.g. Monday 8:30 - 9:30 -> 0, Monday 9:30 - 10:30 -> 1, Monday 10:30 - 11:30 -> 2, etc)
2. put all tutor data in tutor array
3. put all student data in student array
4. match student timeslot with tutor timeslots
5. generate a matching list
6. calculate the number of matching for each student
7. prioritize student list according to the number of matched timeslots 
   (lesser has higher priority while morer has low priority)
8. select one timeslot for each student as the final matching

Further development
1. prioritize the final output (student1 > student 2, etc)
2. improve matching method
3. improve the methodology for timeslot selection
